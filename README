The %{scl_name} package provides DevAssistant 0.9 as a Software Collection.
For more information about Software Collections, see the scl(1) man page.

Installing the %{scl_name} Software Collection gets you DevAssistant 0.9
with several assistants that make it easy for you to kick-start your
projects using DTS 3 and the system Python interpreter.

Usage: scl enable %{scl} 'da --help'

Software Collections allow you to build and execute applications
which are not located in the file system root hierarchy but instead are
stored in an alternative location. The location is %{scl_prefix} in case
of the % {scl_name} Software Collection.

DevAssistant is a general purpose tool, featuring a powerful DSL used to
write plugins. These plugins, called assistants, can help you perform
various development-related tasks, such as kick-starting a project, working
with source code management tools and IDEs, working with remote
repositories, dependency installation, and more.

Assistants provided by the devassist09 Software Collection can help you set
up a basic structure of C, C++, Java (Maven) and Python projects. They also
allow you to import these projects into Eclipse shipped with DTS 3. Each
project you create includes basic source files and a pre-created git
repository.

When you want to start working with the %{scl_name} Software Collection, use
the scl utility to enable the scl environment. See the scl(1) man page for
usage.

Examples:
scl enable %{scl_name} 'da --help'
  Run DevAssistant from the %{scl_name} Software Collection.

scl enable %{scl_name} 'man da'
